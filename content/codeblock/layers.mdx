# Layers

```python
neuralpy.layers
```

Layers are the building blocks of a Neural Network. A complete Neural Network model consists of several layers. A Layer is a function that receives a tensor as output, computes something out of it, and finally outputs another transformed tensor.

## Supported Layers
  - Linear Layers
      - [Dense](/dense)
      - [Bilinear](/bilinear)
  - Convolutional Layers
  - Pooling Layers
  - Normalization Layers
  - Recurrent Layers
  - Other Layers
